          echo "APP_NAME=${{ env.APP_NAME }}"
          echo "SAFE_BASENAME=${{ env.SAFE_BASENAME }}"
          echo "BUILDER_IMAGE_VERSION=${{ env.BUILDER_IMAGE_VERSION }}"
          echo "BUILD_ID=${{ env.BUILD_ID }}"
          echo "BUILDER_ID=${{ env.BUILDER_ID }}"
          echo "ARTIFACT_DIR=${{ env.ARTIFACT_DIR }}"
          echo "NEXT_VERSION=${{ env.NEXT_VERSION }}"
```
